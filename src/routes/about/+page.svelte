				<h3 class={h3}>Studying software development</h3>
				<div class={body}>
					In May 2022, I graduated with a <span class={label}>degree in software development</span> from San Francisco State
					University. <br /><br />There, I built a solid foundation in frontend development and a
					knack for detail-oriented work. It was also there that I got my first introduction in product
					design when I took the Human-Computer Interactions course in my senior year.

				<h3 class={h3}>Moving into design</h3>
				<div class={body}>
					I got my first taste in product design when I took the Human-Computer Interactions course
					in my senior year at university. Although I enjoyed frontend development immensely, I was
					immediately drawn to product design and did everything I could to learn more including
					attending talks, taking certificate programs and participating in hackathons as a
					designer. <br /> <br />To my advantage, <span class={label}>the skills that I learned in frontend development
					helped expedite my designer education and even helped me prototype, build and test my own
					designs</span>.

			<div class={div}>
				<h3 class={h3}>Trulioo</h3>
				<div class={body}>
					In June 2022, I was able to secure my first professional experience at Trulioo as an
					product design intern where I was responsible for assisting in various features and
					projects throughout our platform. <br/><br/>Within three months, I was able to <span class={label}>convert early to a
					full time position due to great performance reviews and now work primarily in design
					systems</span> at Trulioo.
