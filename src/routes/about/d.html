                    <span>
                        I bring a unique lens to product design through combining my development
                        background and technical know-how with strong design skills and sensibilities. I
                        pride myself in bridging the gap between designer and developer, ensuring that the
                        perfect experience gets delivered to the users!
                        <br /><br />
                        I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects across different disciplines,
                        including B2B platforms, internal tools, and identity technologies. I am currently
                        interested in opportunities that will allow me to leverage my unique position as a
                        designer who can talk code and elevate the standard for technical and visual implementations.
                        <br /><br />
